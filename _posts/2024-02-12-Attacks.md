## Lapsus$
Group of young hackers whose objectives are high level companies. Are well know for request for actions in the companies like global decisions instead of ask for money. 

- **Looking for Privilage Data**: They search public repositories with exposed credentianls or tokens that allow access to companies.

- **Recruit Employees**: They offer money for privileged information such as access credentials to VPNs or other data for employees who work in big companies or people who have this information.

The principal objective of this organization is steal credentials to gain access in private corporate networks like IAM systems, remote desktop applications and more.

### MFA Bypass
- **Steal passwords**: With steal passwords they can activate simple MFA.
  
-  **Workstations and personal accounts**: With this stealed information the attacants can bypass MFA.
  
-  **Sim-swapping**: SIM swapping is a scam that involves fraudulently duplicating the SIM card of a person's cell phone. First, the cybercriminal impersonates the victim's identity to obtain the duplicate. Then, once the victim is left without phone service, he accesses his personal information and takes control of his digital banking using the verification SMS that arrive at the phone number.
-  
### Privalage Escalation
-  **Exploit internal server vulnerabilities**: Servers which software are not updated is exploited to grab privilaged credentials.
  
-  **Colaboration Apps**: Applications for colaboration purposes that the employees may share credentials or critic information.
  
-  **Spoofing**: The attakers can spoof employee identity  for request to tecnical support change credentials.

## CVE-2021-44228 Log4j
Vulneravbility with a CVSS score of 10, easy to exploit and millions of servers were vulnerable.
  
This vulnerability have a big impact due to JAR structure files. An JAR archive contains a tree of packages and subpackages which in turn uses more JAR's to satisfy dependencies so Log4j library may be hidden in several layers.

JNDI Java Naming and Directory Interface is and API to discover, search and fetch Java Seralized Objects.

JNDI uses diferents interfaces of service provider like Corba for distribuited object comunication or LDAP for access to distribuited directories.

While an attack the attacker create and JNDI query using an attaker service provider, for example a LDAP controled for attacker. Runnig the query the server get and malware object to do RCE (Remote Control Execution). This is named JDNI Inyection. The attaker passess query in HTTP Headers or formulary fields that registry queries and be read for Log4j.

After CVE was published in 72 hours have been 830.000 attacks.

## Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) Matanbuchus and Phishing

### Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is a penetration and post-exploitation testing tool used primarily by computer security professionals and network security operations teams (network teaming) to simulate cyber attacks and evaluate the security of systems and networks. It was developed by Strategic Cyber LLC.

BEACON is the name of Cobalt Strike's default malware payload used to create a connection to the team server. Active callback sessions of a target are also called "beacons".

The attack start respond to emails with subject RE, adjunt a zip with a html file codified in base64, this extrack an package of instalation digitaly certified. Then, in second plane put DLL paylods, when MSI executes, the system recovery DLL with malware and create a task that keep malware, in spite of, restart. Paralely MSI shows a update message to distract the victim. The malware creates a Cobalt beacon to do Command and Control.
